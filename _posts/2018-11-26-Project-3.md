For Project 3 we had to change the HTML and CSS code of a website. I decided to choose reflexmath.com, because it is very easy to edit the CSS, and it has a nice theme to begin with so it was easier to make a nice color scheme.

## Description

For my project I decided to make a halloween theme for Reflex Math. I used the Reflex Math site because it was easier to edit the CSS than other websites that I tried, and it looked nice when it was done. I changed all of the green and whites to orange (#ffa500), black (#111), white (#fff), and dark pine green (#228B22). I think it looks pretty decent, although there was a certain bit of background that I couldn't change the color of, which I believe was because it has a picture on the background and I think that the background is being included in the picture in the code.
