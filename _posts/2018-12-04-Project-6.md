## Theme 

![Jasper2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jekyller/jasper2/master/assets/screenshot-desktop.jpg)

I think that I would like to use this theme for my website instead of the bland one that I currently have. It has a very nice layout, with space to get information across as well as interest visitors to the website through pictures and colors. This theme is calles Jasper2, created by the coding team Ghost. When I put it into use on my website I will definitely be changing the pictures to more related pictures, and making things purple because purple is great. 

## A New Page

A new page that I might make could be a page that talks about the problems that I have throughout my time making and critiquing the website. I believe that this can be helpful for both me and other people. It will let other people know what I have problems with, and maybe I could figure out how to put in a place where people could give me feedback and tell we what I did and didn't do well. It would help me improve my skills and it would be more interactive for the visitors of the website.
