## Theme 

![Jasper2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jekyller/jasper2/master/assets/screenshot-desktop.jpg)

I think that I would like to use this theme for my website instead of the bland one that I currently have. It has a very nice layout, with space to get information across as well as interest visitors to the website through pictures and colors. This theme is calles Jasper2, created by the coding team Ghost. When I put it into use on my website I will definitely be changing the pictures to more related pictures, and making things purple because purple is great. 

## A New Page

A new page that I might make could be a page that talks about the problems that I have throughout my time making and critiquing the website. I believe that this can be helpful for both me and other people. It will let other people know what I have problems with, and it would let me see what I need to advance on myself.

## A New Feature

I would love to add a new feature under the new page that allows people to give me feedback on what I have done well and what I need to improve on. Not only would it let me gauge how well I am doing and what I need to improve on, it would also let the visitors of the website contribute to the site a little bit, which would be pretty cool.
